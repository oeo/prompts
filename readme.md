# âŒ§ ward

a secure file archival tool that uses GPG encryption and Git versioning. ward helps you maintain encrypted archives of sensitive files while keeping track of changes over time.

this is a complete rewrite of the [original ward](https://github.com/oeo/ward) project, expanding on its core functionality with additional features and improved user experience.

## manual install

1. clone the repository
2. make sure you have `gpg` installed and configured
3. `npm install` to install dependencies
4. the `ward` binary is available in `./bin/ward`

## quick overview

put files in the `./private` directory and create an encrypted archive.

```bash
echo "hello" > ./private/test.txt
ward pack
```

commit the archive.

```bash
git commit -m "add new archive"
```

**access files:**

```bash
ward ls                     # list all archives
ward cat latest/test.txt    # view file contents
ward cat 0/test.txt         # view file contents from index 0 (same as latest)
ward restore                # restore latest archive and extract to ./private 
```

## configuration
`ward` instances are configured using environment variables or in your local `.env` file:

- `WARD_GPG_KEY` (optional) - specific GPG key to use for encryption/decryption
  - format: last 16 characters of your key ID, email, or name
  - if not set, uses your default GPG key
- `WARD_GPG_RECIPIENTS` (optional) - additional GPG recipients who can decrypt files
  - format: comma-separated list of emails or key IDs
  - example: `user1@example.com,user2@example.com`
  - if not set, encrypts only for `WARD_GPG_KEY` or default key
- `WARD_PRIVATE_FOLDER` (optional) - custom private folder path
  - default: `private`
  - relative to project root
  - contains the files to be encrypted

- `WARD_ARCHIVE_FOLDER` (optional) - custom archive folder path
  - default: `.archives`
  - relative to project root
  - stores the encrypted archives

**example `.env` file**

```env
# use specific GPG key
WARD_GPG_KEY=your.email@example.com

# allow multiple recipients to decrypt
WARD_GPG_RECIPIENTS=user1@example.com,user2@example.com

# custom folder paths
WARD_PRIVATE_FOLDER=secret-stuff
WARD_ARCHIVE_FOLDER=my-archives
```

## commands

### ls
list archives and files within them.

![listing archives](assets/ls.png)

```bash
ward ls [options] [archive-ref]

# examples
ward ls                  # list all archives
ward ls --limit 5        # show 5 most recent
ward ls 2                # show archive at index 2
ward ls 66b              # show archive with hash 66b7d91
```

options:
- `--json` - output in JSON format
- `--limit N` - limit output to N entries (0 for unlimited)

### cat
view file contents from an archive.

```bash
ward cat <archive-path>

# examples
ward cat latest/test.txt     # from latest archive
ward cat 2/*.md              # all markdown files from index 2
ward cat 66b/config.json     # from archive with hash 66b7d91
ward cat 66b7d91/config.json # from archive with hash 66b7d91
```

### cp
copy files from any archive to the local filesystem.

```bash
ward cp <archive-path> <destination>

# examples
ward cp latest/test.txt ./local/   # copy to local directory
ward cp '2/*.md' ./docs/           # copy all markdown files
ward cp '66b/*.txt' ./backup/      # copy from specific archive
```

### less
view file contents from an archive with pager.

```bash
ward less <archive-path>

# examples
ward less latest/test.txt
ward less 2/*.md
ward less 66b/config.json
ward less 66b7d91/config.json
```

### verify
check integrity of an archive.

```bash
ward verify [archive-ref]

# examples
ward verify            # verify latest
ward verify 2          # verify index 2
ward verify 66b        # verify hash 66b7d91
```

options:
- `--json` - output in JSON format

### restore
extract files. this will restore the specified archive to the `private` directory.

![restoring an archive](assets/restore.png)

```bash
ward restore [archive-ref]

# examples
ward restore          # latest archive
ward restore 2        # archive at index 2
ward restore 66b      # archive with hash 66b7d91
ward restore 66b7d91  # archive with hash 66b7d91
```

options:
- `--json` - output in JSON format

### pack
create a new archive based on the contents of the `private` directory. files included in the `.encignore` file (if it exists) are excluded from the archive.

```bash
ward pack [options]

# examples
ward pack             # create if changes detected
ward pack --force     # create regardless of changes
```

options:
- `--force` - create archive even if no changes detected

### clean 
remove old archives

```bash
ward clean  # remove all but most recent uncommitted archive
```

## archive references
archives can be referenced in three ways:

1. **by index number**
   ```bash
   ward ls 0         # most recent archive
   ward ls 1         # second archive in list
   ```

2. **by commit hash**
   ```bash
   ward ls 66b       # using first 3 chars
   ward ls 66b7      # using first 4 chars
   ward ls 66b7d91   # using full hash
   ```

3. **special references**
   ```bash
   ward ls latest    # most recent archive
   ```

## file paths
ward uses unix-like paths to access files within archives:

```bash
latest/file.txt      # file from latest archive
0/file.txt           # file from index 0 (same as latest)
2/docs/*.md          # all markdown files from archive index 2
66b/config.json      # config from archive with commit hash 66b7d91
66b7d91/config.json  # config from archive with commit hash 66b7d91
```

- leading slash is optional
- glob patterns are supported
- paths are relative to archive root

## security
- all files are encrypted using gpg
- private keys never leave your system
- archives can be safely stored in git
- each archive is independently encrypted

## @todo
- [x] add support for GPG key passphrase
- [ ] restructure so that the ward package can be imported into other projects easily
- [ ] bin/ward should be smaller in terms of lines of code
- [ ] dockerize to remove dependency and installation issues
- [ ] add unit testing
- [ ] add more examples
- [ ] add more documentation
